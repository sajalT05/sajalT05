<p>Hi, I'm Sajal Tiwari.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like any average person on the earth, I too share the same past story as others, i.e. a lot of confusion, unwanted sacrifices, self-doubt, tonnes of problems, wishful thinking, and almost no guidance. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But one of the key factors (my superpower) which pushes me ahead is the dream I had during childhood, <strong>solve all the world problems, one by one</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In our world, we have countless problems, but the process of finding their solution is the same, i.e. <strong>Innovation</strong>. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I have a very clear vision in my life, <strong>build a prosperous future for humanity</strong>. Thus, the process of <strong>bringing new ideas and executing over them to solve specific problems </strong>is the only mission I have left in my life.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Entrepreneurial Journey</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":199,"sizeSlug":"large","linkDestination":"none"} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/sajaltiwari.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/about-sajal-tiwari-entrepreneurial-journey-edited.png" alt="" class="wp-image-199"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The entrepreneurial addition caught me in my college life. The reason was simple, it defined the path to fulfill my childhood dream. During my college days, I started a website startup NIT Sparrows(<a href="http://www.nitsparrows.com">nitsparrows.com</a>), and freelancing by providing IT services to businesses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right after graduation, I continued with freelancing (to build more network and business relations) for almost 3 years by providing business-related services to corporate clients in Mumbai. The Journey was very tough. Mumbai is among the expensive city in India and I had to manage all the expenses on my own (because I'm an entrepreneur and I've to learn the art of independence and struggle). But the 3-year journey taught me a lot about life, mindset, and business.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, 2020 came the year of COVID-19 surge in India with extreme lockdowns and whatnot, this pandemic continued till 2021 end. I decided to give life momentum. A concept I learned during my school days and applied in real life during college, i.e. in a 3D space a moving body has to eject some mass either to speed up or change direction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thus I decided to create my own path to fulfill the goals I've with my life.</p>
